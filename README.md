# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C repository! This repo contains various DSA implementations in C, making it a great resource for both beginners and those preparing for coding interviews.

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-c.git
   ```

**2. Explore the Code:**

   Browse through folders to find the data structures and algorithms you need. Each folder typically includes:

   - C code for the algorithm or data structure.
   - Helpful comments to explain the code.
   - Sample inputs and outputs.

**3. Compile and Run:**

   To compile and run any C program, you can use a C compiler like GCC. For instance:

   ```
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ./filename
   ```

**4. Contribute:**
